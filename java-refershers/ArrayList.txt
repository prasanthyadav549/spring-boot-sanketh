## Disadvantages of Arrays
  1. Static size 
  2. mention size in the start
  3. store similar data types 

  # Static size problem: lets say there are 50 students in the class we created the array of 
    size 50. now 2 more students are added we need to create the new array of size 52 and 
    copy previous array elements and add these 2.

  # Mention Size in Start : lets say we declared an array of size 50 . But we are storing only
                            5 elements. then it is wasting of the remaining size.
    

## ArrayList:
   1. allows us to create the resizable arrays.
   2. also known as the dynamic arrays.
