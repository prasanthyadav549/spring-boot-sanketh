## things to search and get clarified
  1. why we don't use autowired and use the constructor 
     based injection.
  2. primary vs qualifier
  3. learn about @scope annotation.

## problems of using @autowired
  1. field injection or using @autowired annotation 
     makes the testing procedure very hard .

## Reasons to multiple concreate classes of the abstract class.
   for example 
     we have one abstract service layer interface 
       and there are 2 service concrete classes that are 
       implementing this abstract service layer.
Solution : lets assume we have a ecommerce app and 
           it is having the 2 payment gateways.
           PAYMENT GATEWAYS:
              1. Razorpay 
              2. stripe 
           for a particular type of request I always want to use 
           the Razorpay but the request is international. we cant 
           use the Razorpay we need to use the stripe.
           in this case we need the 2 instances in the same 
           controller.
