      business functionality to the outer world so that they can 
      actually use it.

       1. If we follow Rest api conventions then our APIS  
          become more consistent , readable , stadard that a 
          lot of developers use .

PRINCIPLES OF REST - 1. All the APIS are designed around the resources.
                        Resource - any kind of object , data , serive or 
                        real life entity that a client can access.

                        format for it.

                     3. if you want to send the data from client to server then 
                        there are 3 ways 
                           -> Query Params
