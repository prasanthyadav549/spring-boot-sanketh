## Native Query
  1. the column names should be as it is.
  example query:
          @Query(nativeQuery = true ,value = "select * from Driver where id=:id AND license_number=:licenseNumber")
          Optional<Driver> rawFindByIdAndLicenseNumner(Long id, String licenseNumber);

  2. errors in the raw sql queries are not identified in the compile time.


## Hibernate Query Language
   1. the column names can be of time camel case.
   2. to resolve the problem that is present in the raw sql query like 
      the errors in the raw sql are not identified in the compile time 
      HQL is fixed that problem. in HQL the errors are identified in the 
      compile time.
   3. select *  * will not work in the HQL. 
   4. example:  @Query("select d from Driver as d where d.id = :id AND d.licenseNumber=:licenseNumber")
                Optional<Driver> hqlFindByIdAndLicenseNumber(Long id, String licenseNumber);
