## JDBC : provides the direct db interaction . the queries are written in string and psss to the JDBC function 
          
          1. Jdbc has connection managers know as the DriverManager class using which we will connect to the 
             Databases.gives access to the connection pool of the databases.

JDBC is old way of doing things . we JPA .


## JPA : means java persistence API . JPA is specification for accessing , persisting and managing the data
         between the java objects and Relation tables.

         1. JPA is a ABSTRACTION LAYER on top of the JDBC which internally used the JDBC .

         2. Instead of using the RAW queries in jdbc now due to intoduction of JPA we use the 
            classes , Objects and methods .

         3. JPA contains the interfaces and the annotations.
         4. Using the JPA interfaces and annotations ORM are the classes that implements those interfaces.
